# 3d-game-engine
**This project is an ascii-character-based 3D engine!**
Based on a the javidx9 code-it-yourself, but re-written in javascript.

This project uses only the simplest of outputs, no canvas, no get animation frame, just text written to a screen!
**Includes all-new i/o**: a custom render-engine, and an input handler!
