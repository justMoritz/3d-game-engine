# 3d-game-engine
### This project is an ascii-character-based 3D engine!
Based on a the javidx9 code-it-yourself, but written in JavaScript, although not in the way you think :)

It features:
- improved raycasting, for calculating layers of foregrounds, backgrounds, floors, and different height blocks
- all-new i/o: I wrote a custom input handler, pixel-render-engine to paint the characters to the screen, and combine layers.
- I'm using only the simplest of outputs: no canvas, no get animation frame, just text on a screen!

Other, very cool advanced features and things added:

- Looking up and down!
- Implemented image Skewing for looking up and down
- Textures!
- Shaded Textures! (aka almost lighting)

Current Dec. 3rd Issues:
- Performance
- Interface
- Ground-objects when looking up and down
- Jumping when looking up

TODO:
- Asset Loader (Maps, Textures)
- Sprites?
